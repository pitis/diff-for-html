    But in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitaldefense.com/news/zero-day-cpanel-and-webhost-manager/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>&nbsp;today, Digital Defense says that the 2FA implementation on older cPanel
    &amp; WebHost Manager (WHM) software was vulnerable to brute-force attacks that allowed threat actors to guess URL parameters and bypass 2FA — if 2FA was enabled for an account.
</p>
<p>While brute-forcing attacks, in general, usually take hours or days to execute, in this particular case, the attack required only a few minutes.</p>
<p>
    While this might make some website owners think the bug is not important, it's actually the opposite since 2FA solutions were invented in the first place to protect against the use of phished credentials, and, as a result, any 2FA
    bypass like this bug needs to be treated with the utmost urgency and attention.
